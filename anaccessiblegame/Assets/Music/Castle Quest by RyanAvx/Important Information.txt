Thank you for downloading/purchasing the Breezy's Castle Quest album!#
-===================================================================-

This is a chiptune asset pack created by me, inspired by the classic
Castlevania franchise. I used many similar techniques found in the 
older Castlevania games from the NES and Super Nintendo, but made
in the Unlimited Chiptune style.

There are tracks for the title, game over and victory, as well as a 
collection of level tracks. This should cover more or less an entire
game's soundtrack, but please don't feel limited to just using it
in a game inspired by Castlevania. The tracks have a high energy feel
and would be suitable for many fantasy/medieval action style games,
or even just casual listening, for that nostalgia!

                          Usage Rights

and duration to that of the game's creator, in either a credits
screen in game and on the page's about section.

the album's comment section, twitter DM or itch.io DM. Please

3 - If requested, please provide a video or gif of the game so
that I may use it on social media to promote the album.

All rights are reserved by me, and the music on the album may

                       Looping Instructions
-==============================================================-

Many of the tracks were designed with looping in mind, though 
several have 'intros' and 'outros' that you may have to
exclude when you import the music into your game.

Mondlicht Tanz - Loop starts at 10s in.
Kittens Vampyrjakt - Loop starts at 7s in.
Dance of Doom - Loop starts at 5.455s in, ends at 48.96s.
